 <tr><td class="center1">Education</td><td class="tdleft1">Prior to coming to college I had no experience with technology at all. I began teaching myself through Youtube on how to build computers. After taking a few basic CS classes at Edcc I gained a better understanding on what I wanted to do. From there I have taken and am continuing
 to take server based classes with the main focus being Microsoft Server 2016. On the side I have taken classes in Linux, Html, and hardware classes in the attemptss to gain a basic understanding of as many subjects as I can.
 The main goal that I wish to achieve is to obtain my AA with as many certificates that I can. I believe that it is better to have knowledge in as many areas as possible rather than one specific field of view.</td></tr>
