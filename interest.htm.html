		<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Airsoft is my favorite outdoor sport/activity. It involves a military silmultion in which you shoot the opposing teach with airsoft guns ( mimicking real life guns) shooting plastic bb's. <br/>
		this is different form games such as Nerf darts in that these bb are often air or electric powered and shoot at musch higher velocity. This sport is as close as you can get to war without <br/>
		being in the real thing.<a href="https://www.paintballstation.com/"> The Paintball station </a>located in Mount. Vernon Washington, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TAAGSairsoft/?_cookie-check=KL5sRKjjoFLvg-GwTaags"> Taags</a> 
		in Renton Washington are my favorite places to play.</p>

		<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Getting out in nature is very important to me and I am lucky to have a dog who will join me on them. Exploring parks and trails in the area. If my dog is not with my then I like to transition the walks into
		<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleUrbEx/"> urban exploring</a>. This involves Exploring areas that are abandoned, more out of the way, tunnels, or any place that is typically not given access to the public.
		While staying legal of course.</p>

What I mean by this is I like to keep my knowledge current with all of the latest devices on the market. I do this for a variety of reasons such as security issues with devices, if a new products should replace an old, or to help others understand
		what is out there to choose from. As strange as it sounds, Newegg.com is a good took to start seeing what new in the tech world due to their large amount of products.</p>
