<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last web page is
meant to serve as a summary of my experiences and knowledge that I am
taking away from this course. I went into this class with the goal of
better understanding how to make a website
in order to help my mom start up her business. It was also just for the
fun of knowing how websites work in the first place. a few weeks into
the class and realizing how easy it really is to type HTML
I got hooked on it and had a new passion for website building. In the
future I would like to turn this into a hobby just to test around my
skills and maybe host my own website some day. I wish I had more time
this quarter to learn more about CSS and XHTML and Java as I know those
are key to making a good website but due to the nature of full time
college this will have to wait.
As time goes on I do plan to update this website of mine to further
express the skill that I am continuing to learn on my own time. The
biggest AHA! moment I had was actually rather minor
to most people and that was how links to other websites or even the
same pages as yours work. This opens up a world of possibilities to
stay connected.<br>
