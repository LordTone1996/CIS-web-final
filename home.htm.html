<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
was born in Jutiapa Guatemala and 	 	
raised by a foster family until I was adopted at age 9 months by my
mom. We remain
in contact with the foster family via Facebook and visited them when we
returned
to Guatemala when we visited them 34 years ago. during that trip to my
homeland
my mom and I explored my country of birth. We went to the Norther Mayan
ruins,
to the capital of Guatemala. And lake Atitlan, and the original capital
city of
Guatemala Antigua. I am proud of my Guatemalan heritage but am also
glad that
my mom adopted me and that I can enjoy the benefits of the good life
that we
have here in the united states.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
live in Portland Oregon until
the first grade when we moved to the Seattle area to be close to all of
our
family. My grandparents invited us to live with them for a year while
my mom searched
for a job and we found a new house as I started first grade in their
neighborhood.
As it turned out we great House mates and my mom and I remained in
their home
until the time of my grandparents passing two years ago. I had a close
relation
sup with my grandparents and I helped my mom and her sisters take care
of my
grandparents when they got elderly. I was with each of them when they
passed
away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
had started college at Bellevue community
college and was working on a personal fitness training degree when I
got very
sick. I was unable to continue attending school and I had to quit my
job. During
my recovery from being sick I taught myself how to build a computer by
watching
YouTube videos and found my new passion. in a way it was good thing
that my illness
caused me to stop and rethink my college goals. IT is the path that I
want to pressure
for my career.</p>
